Cell Processes
Chloroplast is a structure containing chlorophyll (a special pigment). What makes chlorophyll so special? - Chlorophyll can absorb light to transform it into chemical energy. - Chlorophyll is the center of cell synthesis in a plant - Chlorophyll can change color depending on the season - Chlorophyll fulfills all the roles of that cells would have otherwise done.

Which of these is the name of the entire process in which plants transform energy? - Photosynthesis - Light Absorption - Calvin Cycle - Kreb Cycle

In which of these processes is the ETC directly involved? - Light Reaction - Dark Reaction - Kreb Cycle - Glycolysis

In which photosystem is light absorbed in photosynthesis? - Photosystems I and II - Photosystem I - Photosystem II - Photosystem III

Glycolysis is a process which converts... - glucose to pyruvate - pyruvate to glucose - maltose to glucose - glucose to maltose

In which reaction (also known as a dark reaction) do plants create sugar? - Calvin Cycle - Citric Acid Cycle - Glycolysis - Energy Transfer

In the gas exchange, which two gases are typically involved? - Oxygen and CO2 - Nitrogen and Hydrogen - Oxygen and Nitrogen - CO2 and Hydrogen

Which molecule is primarily used in cellular energy transfer? - ATP - ADP - AMP - Phosphates in general

Which type of molecule is NOT used in protein synthesis? - Fatty Acids - Amino Acids - DNA -RNA

Glucose is broken down in... - the Krebs Cycle - Glucose Desynthesis - Dehydrolysis - Hydrolysis

Water
In diffusion across a membrane, molecules move from a - higher concentration to a lower concentration - lower concentration to a higher concentration - lighter place to a darker place - darker place to a ligher place

The indicator bromothymol blue is colorless when... - The pH is close to neutral - The pH is more acidic - The pH is more basic - bromothymol blue does not turn colorless

The difference between pOH and pH is that... - All of the above - There is an extra O in the name - pOH measures hydroxyl group concentration while pH measures hydrogen concentrations - Higher numbers are acidic in pOH

The process of linking molecule monomers is... - dehydrolysis (removal of 2 hydrogens and an oxygen) - hydrolysis (addition of 2 hydrogens and an oxygen) - a series of hydrolysis and dehydrolysis - the force

Permeability is a quality of a material that measures how much liquid or gas can pass through the material. Some membranes are semi-permeable, or only allow some things in. They do this through... - facilitated diffusion - the polarity of water - acidity - alkalinity

Organelles
In a cell, your RNA is stored in... - the nucleolus - the cytoplasm - the ribosomes - the vacuoles

What is the nucleus protected by? - The nuclear membrane - The cell wall - The nucleolus - The cytoplasm

The rough endoplasmic reticulum contains ribosomes, which are part of creating which macromolecule? - Proteins - Lipids - Carbohydrates - DNA

On the other hand, the smooth endoplasmic reticulum creates which macromolecule? - Lipids - Proteins - Carbohydrates- DNA

The job of a vacuole in a cell is to... - store molecules - create vitamins - fill up space - release molecules

What is the area in a cell not taken up by organelles called? - The cytoplasm - The cell's plasma - The gaseous area - There is no name

What job(s) do lysosomes have in a cell? - All of the above - Breakdown of food - Disposal of waste - Discarding unneeded organelles

Which organelle in a cell creates the most ATP? - The mitochondria - The smooth endoplasmic reticulum - The rough endoplasmic reticulum - None of these

What protects a plant cell? - A combination of the cell membrane and cell wall - The cell wall - The cell membrane - None of the above

An enzyme is a protein which makes certain processes happen faster. - Cool - Meh - So? - OK? (Iunno, if you can think of something change it.)
